# Document heading

This document has several headings that will all match the pattern `^%%`.

## %% (Heading 1)

Every heading should match.

# %% (Heading 2)

This one included.

## %% (Heading 3)

This heading would match, but since it's a child of Heading 2 it will be included in the previous section.
