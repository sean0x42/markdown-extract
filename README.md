A magical tool belt for working with markdown. You can:

## Installation ðŸ§™

> TODO

You probably also want to add an alias to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

```bash
alias md="markdown-magic"
```

## Usage

### Preview

### Build

Coming soon!

### Format

### Extract

The `extract` command lets you pull out sections of markdown according to
a regular expression. Given a document called `my-document.md`:

```markdown
# Welcome!

This is my amazing markdown document.

## Extract me!

This section should be pulled out.
```

We could then extract the second section with the following command:

```console
$ markdown-magic extract "Extract me!" my-document.md
## Extract me!

This section should be pulled out.
```

For more help and configuration, use the following command:

```console
$ markdown-magic help extract
```
